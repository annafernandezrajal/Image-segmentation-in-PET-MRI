# Image-segmentation-in-PET-MRI

Alzheimer’s is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia. This disease has no current cure but there are treatments available to delay its effect and prevent it from worsening, so an early diagnosis can make a difference. Advanced deep learning techniques have shown that it is possible to obtain great results in the detection of Alzheimer’s and thus many studies have been done on the topic, here we will focus on the image segmentation that will allow to have better results on later techniques. We implemented the processing for MRI scans to enhance the classification of Alzheimer’s disease.
